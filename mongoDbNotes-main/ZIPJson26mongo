To perform the task using MapReduce in MongoDB on the zip.json collection, follow the steps outlined below:
________________________________________
Step 1: Import zip.json into MongoDB
1.	Make sure the zip.json file is located on your system. For this example, let’s assume it’s located at C:\data\zip.json on Windows or /path/to/your/data/zip.json on macOS/Linux.
2.	Use the mongoimport command to import the file:
o	On Windows:
Bash code:
mongoimport --db library --collection zip --file C:\data\zip.json --jsonArray
o	Explanation: This command imports the zip.json file into a zip collection within the library database.

Step 2: Use MapReduce to Calculate the Total Population in Each State
1.	Open the MongoDB Shell:
Bash code
mongosh
2.	Switch to the library Database:
Code:
use library
3.	Define the Map Function:
Code:
var mapFunction = function() {
    emit(this.state, this.population);
};
o	Explanation: The mapFunction emits the state as the key and the population as the value.
4.	Define the Reduce Function:
Code:
var reduceFunction = function(state, populations) {
    return Array.sum(populations);
};
o	Explanation: The reduceFunction takes an array of population numbers for each state and sums them up using Array.sum().
5.	Run the MapReduce Operation:
Code:
db.zip.mapReduce(
    mapFunction,
    reduceFunction,
    { out: "total_population_by_state" }
);
o	Explanation: The mapReduce method processes the data using the map and reduce functions and outputs the results into a new collection named total_population_by_state.
6.	View the Results:
Code:
db.total_population_by_state.find().pretty()
o	Explanation: This command retrieves and displays the total population for each state from the total_population_by_state collection.

Summary of MapReduce Process
•	Map Function: Extracts each document's state and population values and emits them.
•	Reduce Function: Aggregates populations for each state by summing them up.
•	Output: The total population per state is stored in a new collection, total_population_by_state.
Notes
•	Performance: MapReduce is powerful but can be slower than using MongoDB's aggregation framework, especially for large datasets. If performance is critical, consider using the aggregation framework as an alternative.
•	Debugging: If any issues occur during the import or execution, double-check file paths and ensure the MongoDB server is running.
This guide will help you calculate the total population for each state using MongoDB's MapReduce functionality.
